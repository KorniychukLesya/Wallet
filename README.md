# Wallet

* This project is based on Nuxt3
* Pinia is used as a repository
* The wallet block is made on the main page, the layout is made on tailwind
* Currency balance values are rounded using decimal.js

This is my first acquaintance with these technologies. It was an interesting and very useful study.
